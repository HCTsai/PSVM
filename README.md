PSVM (SVM.NET with Parallel Optimization)
====

This SVM Library is based on the source code from 
http://www.matthewajohnson.org/software/svm.html with calculation speed improvement.

When finding parameters, C and Gamma, in Grid-search 
using ParameterSelection.PGrid instead of ParameterSelection.Grid 
will increase the calculation speed.
